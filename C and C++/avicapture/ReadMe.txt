AviCapture

This application will allow you to connect to a PixeLINK 4.0 camera and 
continually capture the last 10 minutes of video. 

While capturing video, all data is stored to PixeLINK data stream (PDS) files.
When the user stops capture, the PDS files are converted to avi files. 

NOTE: 
When the user starts capture of video, all PDS files in the current directory are deleted. 

NOTE:
When converting PDS files to avi files, existing avi files will be overwritten.
